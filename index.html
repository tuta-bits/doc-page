                The object-oriented programming language JavaScript is
                 a cross-platform language. It is a translucent and compact
                  language. JavaScript can be attached to the objects of its
                   environment inside a host environment (for instance, a web browser)
                    to offer it programmatic control.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                A standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math,
                 as well as a basic set of language components, such as operators,
                  control structures, and statements, are included in JavaScript.
                   By extending Core JavaScript with additional objects, it can be
                    used for a variety of applications, such as:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                    Client-side JavaScript adds to the fundamental language by providing
                     objects for controlling a browser's Document Object Model (DOM).
                      Client-side extensions, for example, allow a programme to add
                       items on an HTML form and react appropriately to user actions
                        like mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Server-side JavaScript extends the basic language by providing
                     objects required for server-side JavaScript execution. Server-side
                      extensions, for example, allow an application to interface with a
                       database, give information constancy through one programme
                        invocation to the next, or conduct file operations on a server.

            <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
            <article>
              <p>
                In some aspects, JavaScript and Java are similar, yet vastly
                 distinct in others. JavaScript is similar to Java, except it lacks
                  Java's static typing and rigors type checking. JavaScript was
                   renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript because it follows most
                    Java expression syntax, naming conventions, and basic control-flow
                     features.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                JavaScript offers a runtime system based on a small number 
                of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and textual values,
                 as opposed to Java's compile-time system of classes defined via 
                 declarations. Instead of the more usual class-based object model, 
                 JavaScript uses a prototype-based object model. The prototype-based
                  architecture allows for dynamic inheritance, which means that what 
                  is inherited for specific objects can change. JavaScript also offers 
                  functions that don't require any extra declarations. Functions can 
                  be object attributes that run as weakly typed methods.
              </p>
              <p>
                In comparison to Java, JavaScript is a fairly free-form language. 
                All variables, classes, and methods do not need to be declared. 
                You don't have to worry about whether your methods are public, 
                private, or protected, and you don't have to worry about implementing 
                interfaces. The kinds of variables, arguments, and function return types are not 
                specified explicitly.

            <article>
              To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
              your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
              <code>
                <p>Declare a function that outputs "Hello! How are you?" when it is called:</p>
                    function myFunction() {
                    alert("Hello!\nHow are you?");
                  }
              </code>
    
              <p>
                Click the button to watch it unfold on your
                browser!

              <button onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>

            <p>
              You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
              The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
            </p>
            <p>
              A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
              dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
              Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
              "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
              (lowercase).
            </p>
            <p>
              You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
              identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
              characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
              Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

            <article>
              You can declare a variable in three ways:
              <p>
                With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This
                syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
              </p>
              <p>
                By simply assigning it a value. For example,
                <code>x = 42.</code> This always declares a global variable. It
                generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
                variant.
              </p>
              <p>
                With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This
                syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See
                Variable scope below.
              </p>
            </article>
          </section>

          <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
            <header>Variable scope</header>
            <article>
              <p>
                It's considered a global variable when you declare a variable 
                outside of any function, because it's accessible to any other 
                code in the current page. A variable declared within a function 
                is referred to as a local variable since it is only accessible 
                within that function.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                A variable declared within a block is local to the function 
                (or global scope) that the block resides within before ECMAScript 
                2015; instead, a variable declared within a block is local to the 
                function (or global scope) that the block resides within before 
                ECMAScript 2015. Because the scope of x is the function (or global context) 
                within which x is declared, rather than the block, which in this 
                case is an if statement, the following code will log 5.
              </p>
              <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
              <p>
                This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
                ECMAScript 2015.
              </p>
    
              <code>
                    if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
                    not defined
              </code>
            </article>

          <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
            <header>Global variables</header>
            <article>
              <p>
                Global variables are actually global object characteristics. 
                Because the global object in web pages is window, you can use the 
                window variable syntax to set and access global variables.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                As a result, by specifying the window or frame name, you can access 
                global variables declared in one window or frame from another 
                window or frame. For example, if a document declares a variable 
                called phoneNumber, you can refer to it from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
              </p>

          <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
            <header>Constants</header>
            <article>
              <p>
                The const keyword can be used to construct a read-only, named 
                constant. A constant identifier must begin with a letter, 
                underscore, or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or 
                underscore characters, just like a variable identifier.
              </p>
    
              <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
              <p>
                While the script is executing, a constant's value cannot be changed 
                by assignment or re-declared. It must be given a value to begin with.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                Constants follow the same rules as let block scope variables in 
                terms of scope. The identifier is considered to represent a 
                variable if the const keyword is absent.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
                variable in the same scope. For example:
              </p>
    
              <code
                >// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
                WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
                //statements }</code
              >
              However, object attributes are not protected, so the following
              statement is executed without problems.
              <code
                >const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
                "otherValue";</code
              >

            <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>

              <li>
                <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>

                  <li class="mime">
                    null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because
                    JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null,
                    NULL, or any other variant.
                  </li>
                  <li class="mime">

                    Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances
                    are unique and immutable.

                Despite the fact that these data types are insignificant, 
                they allow you to execute valuable activities with your apps. 
                The language's other core features are objects and functions. 
                Objects can be thought of as named containers for values, and 
                functions can be thought of as operations that your programme can execute.

        <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
            <header>if...else statement</header>
            <article>
              Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
              true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the
              condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
    
              <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
              condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
              Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
              condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
              statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any
              statement, including further nested if statements.
              <p>
                You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
                conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
              </p>
              <code
                >if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
                statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
                statement_last; }
              </code>
              In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition
              which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple
              statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In
              general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially
              when nesting if statements:
    
              <code
                >if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
                statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;

              It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional
              expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when
              glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
              <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use
              an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
              additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:
    
              <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>

                While statements are executed as long as a particular condition 
                evaluates to true, they are called while statements. 
                The following is an example of a while statement:
    
              <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes
              false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to
              the statement following the loop.
    
              <p>
                The precondition evaluation executes before the loop's statements 
                are performed. The expression is implemented and the criteria is 
                evaluated anew if the criterion returns true. When the criterion 
                returns false, execution is terminated and control is handed to the
                 while statement.
              </p>
    
              <p>
                To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to
                group those statements.
              </p>
    
              Example:
    
              <p>
                The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
              </p>
    
              <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
              <p>
                With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
                Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
              </p>
    
              <ul>
                <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
                true, so the loop terminates.

            <article>
              A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
              statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
    
              <ul>
                <li>The name of the function.</li>
                <li>
                  A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
                  separated by commas.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in
                  curly brackets, { }.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                For example, the following code defines a simple function named
                square:
              </p>
    
              <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
              <p>
                The square function has only one argument, which is called number. 
                The function is made up of only one statement: return the function's 
                argument (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The value returned by 
                the function is specified by the return statement.
              </p>
              <code>return number * number;</code>
              <p>
                Primitive parameters (like a number) are supplied to functions by 
                value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function 
                changes the parameter's value, the modification is not mirrored 
                globally or in the calling function.
